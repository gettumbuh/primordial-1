# Primordial Experiment 1

The first primordial experiment. This experiment is a controlled experiment to test the experience, perception and the understanding of Tumbuh in a small set of users.

The primordial wallets and plant agents are not autonomous and only mimc a part of the experience users will eventually have.

_The earnings from this experiment will not be realistic as there is no staking process to participate as well as defi earning strategies emloyed by the primordial plant agent._

_The plant will require a different H2O token called 'Primordial water' or PH2O tokens to survive, survival conditions are not enforced on a smart contract._
